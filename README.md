For this project we applied a Deep Q Learning algorithm to find the shortest path to the objective. Computer scientists are professionals who study and develop computational systems and algorithms. Their work encompasses various areas of computer science, including software development, artificial intelligence, data analysis, computer networking, cybersecurity, and more. As a computer scientist, approaching a problem involves a systematic and logical approach. Begin by understanding the problem, clarifying goals and constraints. Gather relevant information and resources to aid in solving the problem. Design an algorithm or solution strategy, implement it in code, and thoroughly test and debug for correctness. Optimize and refine the solution for better efficiency. Finally, document the solution and seek feedback for improvement, maintaining and adapting it as needed.As a computer scientist, you have ethical responsibilities to both the end user and the organization you work for. Firstly, prioritize the end user's well-being and safety by ensuring the reliability, security, and privacy of the systems you develop. Act in their best interests, avoiding any intentional harm or deception. Secondly, fulfill your responsibilities towards the organization by adhering to professional standards, maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive information, and using resources responsibly. Strive for transparency, honesty, and accountability in your work to build trust with both the end user and the organization.
